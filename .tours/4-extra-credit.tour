There's an experienced driver already in your Okta org who wants to join the team. We'll use real-world techniques to bring them under Terraform management.\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- ✅ Completed Tours 1-3\n- ✅ An existing user in your Okta org (not managed by Terraform)\n- ✅ Basic understanding of Terraform state\n\n**🎯 Real-world relevance:** These are essential skills for managing existing infrastructure with Terraform!\n\n**Ready to become a Terraform pit crew chief?** 🏁"
