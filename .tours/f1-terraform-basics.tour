Just like a race car is built from many precisely engineered components, our infrastructure is defined using **Infrastructure as Code** with Terraform.\n\n**What you'll learn:**\n- How Terraform manages infrastructure\n- Okta provider configuration\n- Racing team resource definitions\n- F1-themed practical examples\n\nReady to start your engines? Let's go! 🏁"

The `terraform` block defines:\n\n- **Required version**: Minimum Terraform version needed\n- **Required providers**: External plugins that extend Terraform's capabilities\n\nJust like F1 cars must meet specific technical requirements, our Terraform code must declare its dependencies upfront."

    {
      "file": "main.tf",
      "line": 8,
      "description": "# 🏆 Provider Requirements\n\nThe `required_providers` block is like declaring which tire manufacturer we'll use for the race:\n\n- **source**: Where to download the provider (like a parts supplier)\n- **version**: Which version to use (like tire compound specifications)\n\nThe Okta provider gives us resources to manage identity and access - perfect for our racing team organization!"

      "description": "# 🏁 Racing Teams Module\n\n**NEW: Module-based architecture!** Instead of individual resources, we use modules - this is a production-quality pattern!\n\n**Key concepts:**\n- **Modules** organize related resources together\n- **Source** points to our local module directory\n- **Input variables** pass data to the module\n- **Reusability** - modules can be used in different configurations\n\nThis is how real companies structure their Terraform code! 🏗️"

      "description": "# 🏎️ Racing Drivers Module (Conditional)\n\n**Advanced pattern:** Conditional module deployment!\n\n**Key features:**\n- `count = var.enable_drivers ? 1 : 0` - Deploy only when enabled\n- **Module dependencies** - drivers module uses outputs from teams module\n- **Progressive deployment** - deploy teams first, then drivers\n\n**Real-world value:** This pattern lets you deploy infrastructure incrementally, which is crucial for production environments!"

      "description": "# 🔗 Module Dependencies\n\n**Critical best practice:** How modules share data!\n\n```hcl\nteam_ids   = module.racing_teams.team_ids\nteam_names = module.racing_teams.team_names\n```\n\n**What this demonstrates:**\n- Output from one module becomes input to another\n- Proper dependency management\n- Single source of truth\n\n**Why this matters:** This prevents the state file conflicts we fixed! 🎯"

You now understand:\n\n✅ **Module-based architecture** (production-quality patterns!)\n✅ **Progressive deployment** (teams first, then drivers)\n✅ **Single state file management** (critical best practice)\n✅ **Module dependencies** and data sharing\n✅ **F1-themed practical examples**\n\n**Next steps:**\n1. **Check your environment variables:** `echo $OKTA_ORG_NAME`\n2. **Copy configuration:** `cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars`\n3. **Deploy teams:** `terraform init && terraform apply` (enable_drivers = false)\n4. **Add drivers:** Set `enable_drivers = true` and `terraform apply` again\n\n**Pro tip**: This new workflow teaches production patterns from day one! 🚀"
