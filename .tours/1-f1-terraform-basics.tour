But since this lab focuses on identity management, Okta is our only provider.\n\n When we run `terraform init`, Terraform will download the specified providers from Hashicorp's provider registry.

You can see what's published in the Okta namespace at https://registry.terraform.io/namespaces/okta \n- This provider's docs are online at https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs. When you see \"providers/okta/okta\" in the URL, you know you're reading the docs for the same provider that you imported here. \n\nüí° **Pro Tip**: The provider docs are your best friend!

This can cause rate limit problems as you manage more resources. Modules can help you group resources that change together. This lets Terraform get work done while making as few API calls as possible, like how engineers build race cars to have only the parts they need!   \n\n**Key concepts:**\n- **Modules** organize related resources together\n- **Source** points to our local module directory\n- **Input variables** pass data to the module\n- **Reusability** - modules can be used in different configurations\n\nThis is how real companies structure their Terraform code! üèóÔ∏è"

Sometimes checking a variable and changing Terraform's behavior as a result can be helpful. But Terraform is not the place to do complex logic about what to deploy. If you find yourself using a lot of conditionals like this in your Terraform, step back and consider whether there's a better place in your deployment architecture to keep that logic. \n\n**Key features:**\n- `count = var.enable_drivers ? 1 : 0` - Deploy only when enabled\n- **Module dependencies** - drivers module uses outputs from teams module\n- **Progressive deployment** - deploy teams first, then drivers\n\n**Where are those variables coming from?** We'll configure them soon!"
