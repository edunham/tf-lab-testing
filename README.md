# 🏁 Terraform 101: Racing Team Identity Management

A hands-on workshop that teaches Infrastructure as Code fundamentals using Okta identity management. No prior Terraform experience required.

## 🏆 What You'll Learn

By the end of this lab, you'll understand:
- **Terraform fundamentals**: providers, resources, variables, outputs
- **Infrastructure as Code principles**: declarative configuration, state management
- **Okta identity management**: users, groups, applications, and access control
- **Real-world DevOps practices**: version control, validation, and collaboration

## 🏎️ Scenario

You're managing identity infrastructure for multiple racing teams. You'll set up:

- **Teams**: Velocity Racing, Thunder Motors, Phoenix Speed, Storm Racing
- **Members**: Drivers, engineers, pit crew, and support staff
- **Applications**: Race Dashboard, Timing Portal, Team Communication, Data Analytics

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account (for Codespaces)
- Okta integrator account (see setup below)
- Basic familiarity with command line

### 🔧 Okta Integrator Account Setup

#### Step 1: Create Your Free Okta Integrator Account

1. **Visit** [developer.okta.com](https://developer.okta.com)
2. **Click "Sign Up"** in the top right corner
3. **Fill out the form**:
   - Email address
   - First and last name
   - Company (can use "Personal" or "Learning")
   - Country
4. **Choose "Integrator"** when asked about your role
5. **Complete email verification** - check your inbox and click the verification link
6. **Set your password** when prompted
7. **Choose your Okta domain** - this creates your unique organization URL like `dev-123456.oktapreview.com`

**Important**: Write down your Okta domain URL - you'll need it for configuration!

#### Step 2: Access Your Okta Admin Console

1. **Sign in** to your new Okta organization using the URL from Step 1
2. **You should see the Okta Admin Dashboard** - this confirms your account is ready
3. **Note your org details** in the top-right corner:
   - Your email address
   - Your org domain (e.g., `dev-123456.oktapreview.com`)

#### Step 3: Create an API Token

**What is an API token?** It's a credential that allows Terraform to manage your Okta organization programmatically.

1. **In the Okta Admin Console**, go to **Security** → **API** (in the left sidebar)
2. **Click the "Tokens" tab**
3. **Click "Create Token"**
4. **Enter a token name**: `Terraform Racing Lab` (or similar)
5. **Click "Create Token"**
6. **IMMEDIATELY COPY THE TOKEN** - this is the only time you'll see it!
   - It looks like: `00abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu`
   - Store it somewhere safe (password manager, secure note, etc.)

**⚠️ Security Note**: Treat this token like a password - don't share it or commit it to git!

#### Step 4: Understand Your Okta URLs

Your Okta organization has specific URL formats:

- **Full Org URL**: `https://dev-123456.okta.com` (what you see in the browser)
- **Org Name**: `dev-123456` (the part before `.okta.com`)
- **Base URL**: `okta.com`


### Launch Environment
1. **Open in Codespaces**: Click the green "Code" button → "Codespaces" → "Create codespace"
2. **Wait for setup**: The devcontainer will automatically install Terraform and configure your environment
3. **Verify installation**: Run `terraform --version` in the terminal

### 🔐 Set Up Your Racing Lab Credentials (Secure Method)

**⚠️ SECURITY NOTICE**: Never expose API tokens in your terminal history or commit them to git!

GitHub Codespaces provides **secure secrets management** for sensitive data like API tokens. Use this secure method:

#### **Method 1: GitHub Codespaces Secrets (Recommended)**

1. **Create your Codespaces secrets**:
   - Go to **GitHub.com** → **Settings** (your profile) → **Codespaces**
   - Click **"New secret"** and create these three secrets:

   | Secret Name | Value | Example |
   |-------------|-------|---------|
   | `OKTA_ORG_NAME` | Your org name (before .okta.com) | `dev-123456` |
   | `OKTA_BASE_URL` | Your base URL | `okta.com` |
   | `OKTA_API_TOKEN` | Your API token from Step 3 | `00abc123def456...` |

2. **Grant repository access**:
   - For each secret, select this repository in "Repository access"
   - Click **"Add secret"**

3. **Restart your Codespace** to load the secrets:
   - In VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Codespaces: Stop Current Codespace"
   - Then restart it from GitHub.com

4. **Verify secrets are loaded** (they'll be available as environment variables):
   ```bash
   echo "Org: $OKTA_ORG_NAME"
   echo "Base URL: $OKTA_BASE_URL" 
   echo "Token loaded: $([ -n "$OKTA_API_TOKEN" ] && echo "✅ Yes" || echo "❌ No")"
   ```

#### **Method 2: Temporary Setup (Less Secure)**

⚠️ **Only use this for testing** - secrets won't persist and may be exposed in terminal history:

```bash
# Set temporarily (will be lost when codespace restarts)
read -s -p "Enter your OKTA_ORG_NAME: " OKTA_ORG_NAME && export OKTA_ORG_NAME
read -s -p "Enter your OKTA_BASE_URL: " OKTA_BASE_URL && export OKTA_BASE_URL  
read -s -p "Enter your OKTA_API_TOKEN: " OKTA_API_TOKEN && export OKTA_API_TOKEN
echo "Credentials set temporarily"
```

#### **Verify Your Connection**
```bash
# Test that your credentials work
curl -H "Authorization: SSWS $OKTA_API_TOKEN" \
     "https://$OKTA_ORG_NAME.$OKTA_BASE_URL/api/v1/users/me"
```

**Expected result**: You should see JSON data about your user account.

### 🏁 Test Your Setup

Before starting the exercises, let's verify everything works:

```bash
# Navigate to the first exercise
cd exercises/01-team-formation

# Initialize Terraform (downloads the Okta provider)
terraform init

# Test your configuration (should show 4 groups to be created)
terraform plan
```

**Expected output**: You should see a plan to create 4 Okta groups (racing teams) with no errors.

**If you see errors**, check the troubleshooting section below or verify your credentials.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Okta Account & Credentials Issues

**"Invalid credentials" or "Authentication failed"**
- **Check your API token**: Make sure you copied the full token correctly
- **Verify environment variables**: Run `echo $OKTA_API_TOKEN` to see if it's set
- **Test with curl**: Use the connection test command from setup above
- **Token might be expired**: API tokens don't expire, but they can be deactivated

**"Could not resolve host" or connection errors**
- **Check your org name**: Run `echo $OKTA_ORG_NAME` - should be just `dev-123456`, not the full URL
- **Check your base URL**: Run `echo $OKTA_BASE_URL` - should be `oktapreview.com` for developer accounts
- **Verify your org is active**: Try logging into the Okta admin console manually

**"Insufficient permissions" errors**
- **Integrator accounts have full admin**: This shouldn't happen with developer.okta.com accounts
- **Check if you're using a work Okta account**: Work accounts may have restricted permissions
- **Solution**: Use a developer.okta.com account for this lab

**"API token not found" in Okta console**
- **Tokens are permanent**: Once created, they don't disappear unless deleted
- **Check the right org**: Make sure you're logged into the same org you created the token in
- **Multiple orgs**: You might have multiple Okta orgs - verify you're in the right one

### Terraform Issues

**"terraform: command not found"**
- **Wait for setup**: Codespaces may still be installing dependencies
- **Restart terminal**: Close and open a new terminal
- **Manual install**: Run `terraform --version` to check if it's installed

**"Resource already exists"**
- **Someone else used the same names**: Groups with the same name already exist in your org
- **Solution 1**: Delete the existing groups in Okta admin console
- **Solution 2**: Modify the group names in the terraform files
- **Solution 3**: Import existing resources: `terraform import okta_group.velocity_racing <group-id>`

**"Provider configuration not found"**
- **Run terraform init**: Make sure you've initialized the workspace
- **Check working directory**: Make sure you're in the exercise directory
- **Provider installation failed**: Delete `.terraform/` and run `terraform init` again

**"Terraform state issues"**
- **Corrupted state**: Delete `.terraform/` directory and run `terraform init` again
- **State/reality mismatch**: Run `terraform refresh` to sync state with actual resources
- **Start fresh**: Delete `terraform.tfstate` and `terraform.tfstate.backup` (be careful!)

### Environment & Setup Issues

**Environment variables don't persist**
- **Temporary**: Environment variables only last for the current terminal session
- **Make permanent**: Use the `.bashrc` commands from the setup section
- **Restart terminal**: Close and open terminal after modifying `.bashrc`

**Codespaces not starting correctly**
- **Rebuild container**: In VS Code command palette, run "Codespaces: Rebuild Container"
- **Check creation logs**: Look for errors in the setup process
- **Try different browser**: Sometimes browser issues can cause problems

**VS Code extensions not working**
- **Terraform extension issues**: Check that HashiCorp Terraform extension is installed
- **Restart VS Code**: Reload the window or restart VS Code
- **Check extension settings**: Make sure terraform language server is enabled

### Getting Help

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### **Secrets Management**
- ✅ **Use GitHub Codespaces secrets** for API tokens and sensitive data
- ✅ **Never commit secrets** to git repositories  
- ✅ **Limit secret access** to only repositories that need them
- ❌ **Avoid export commands** in terminal (they expose secrets in history)
- ❌ **Don't share codespaces** with secrets loaded

### **Okta Security**
- 🔑 **Use developer accounts** (developer.okta.com) for labs - they're isolated
- 🔑 **Rotate API tokens** regularly in production environments
- 🔑 **Use least-privilege access** - only grant permissions needed for the task
- 🔑 **Monitor audit logs** in real Okta environments

### **Terraform Security**
- 📁 **Use `.gitignore`** to exclude `terraform.tfvars` and state files
- 📁 **Enable state locking** in team environments
- 📁 **Review plans carefully** before applying changes
- 📁 **Use remote state** for production workloads

### **If You Suspect Secrets Are Compromised**
1. **Immediately revoke** the API token in Okta console
2. **Create a new token** with a different name
3. **Update your Codespaces secrets** with the new token
4. **Check audit logs** for unauthorized activity

## 🏆 Completion Certificates

After completing all three exercises:
1. Run `terraform plan` in the final solution directory - it should show "No changes"
2. Take a screenshot of your Okta admin console showing the created teams and users
3. Share your success with the racing metaphor that resonated most with you!

## 🎯 Next Steps

Ready to advance your Terraform skills? Consider:
