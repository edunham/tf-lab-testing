# Example customizations you might want to try:
#
# 1. Add a new racing team:

#     name             = "Taylor Lightning"
#     experience_years = 8
#     specialty        = "tire_strategy"

# 2. Add a new driver:
# drivers = {
#   # ... existing drivers ...
#   "morgan-rapid" = {
#     first_name      = "Morgan"
#     last_name       = "Rapid"

#     preferred_tire = "wet"
#     racing_style   = "defensive"
#     email_domain   = "lightningspeed.com"
#   }
# }
#
# 3. Add a new racing application:
# racing_applications = {
#   # ... existing apps ...
#   "weather-radar" = {
#     display_name     = "Weather Radar"
#     description      = "Real-time weather tracking for race strategy"
