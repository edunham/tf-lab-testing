# Terraform 101 with Okta - Example Configuration
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize as needed
# This demonstrates progressive infrastructure deployment using modules

# After deploying teams, set this to true and redeploy (Exercise 2)

# REMEMBER: Set your Okta environment variables before running terraform:
# export OKTA_ORG_NAME="your-dev-org"
# export OKTA_BASE_URL="oktapreview.com"  # or "okta.com"
# export OKTA_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"

# EXERCISE INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to terraform.tfvars
# 2. Start with enable_drivers = false
# 3. Run: terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
# 4. Check teams in Okta admin console
# 5. Set enable_drivers = true in terraform.tfvars
# 6. Run: terraform plan (see the driver module changes!)
# 7. Run: terraform apply (deploy the full infrastructure!)
# 8. Experiment with adding new teams or drivers
